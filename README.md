# Colour-Detection
Colour Detection using Pandas &amp; OpenCV


An application that can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them is built in this color detection Python project. For this, a data file that contains the color name and its values is used. Then the distance from each color is calculated and the shortest one is found.
